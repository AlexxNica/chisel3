  * These implicit classes allow one to convert scala.Int|scala.BigInt to
  * Chisel.UInt|Chisel.SInt by calling .asUInt|.asSInt on them, respectively.
  * The versions .asUInt(width)|.asSInt(width) are also available to explicitly
  * mark a width for the new literal.
  *
  * Also provides .asBool to scala.Boolean and .asUInt to String
  *
  * Note that, for stylistic reasons, one hould avoid extracting immediately
  * after this call using apply, ie. 0.asUInt(1)(0) due to potential for
  * confusion (the 1 is a bit length and the 0 is a bit extraction position).
  * Prefer storing the result and then extracting from it.
